# practice

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

 I thought to implement all that was taught in school using dart so I developed a contact keeper application in flutter that sorts a list of contacts using bubble sort algorithm and search through the list using binary search algorithm that I wrote in Dart. The UI is quite basic because I was still learning at the time, might give it a face uplift soon ;-)
